# homesteadpi
Controlling a chicken coop door, watering system, and more with a pi

The goal of this pi is to automate undesireable tasks associated with homesteading. This is primarily done with apscheduler and OpenWeatherAPI. The functionality below is a running list that will be updated as new tasks are added.

1) Automate a chicken door coop to open and close with dawn and dusk
2) Automate watering schedules based on different plant needs and weather forcasts
